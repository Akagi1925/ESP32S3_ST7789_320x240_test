# ESP32S3_ST7789_320x240_test
This is a test program for the esp32s3 development board from this seller ( https://m.tb.cn/h.5nqdsZc?tk=aj7jWg3uJqq ). The seller's support isn't too responsive, and the reference material is rather limited. For ESP32S3 with camera and TFT display development. It is better to choose the official ESP32-EYE or equivalent third-party hardware. I hope this can help you kickstart your esp32s3 development. And this is solely based on the previous work of Adafruit and other open-source libraries.
